# IoT Weather Station

This project is a fully functional weather station that collects environmental data and makes it accessible remotely through a web dashboard.

## Features

- Real-time temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure monitoring
- Solar-powered with battery backup
- WiFi connectivity for data transmission
- Custom web dashboard for data visualization
- Historical data tracking and graphing

## Hardware Components

- ESP32 microcontroller
- BME280 environmental sensor
- Solar panel and LiPo battery
- Custom PCB for power management
- 3D-printed weatherproof enclosure

## Software Stack

- Arduino framework for the ESP32
- MQTT protocol for data transmission
- Node.js backend for data processing
- Chart.js for data visualization
- MongoDB for data storage

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to gain experience in:
- Power-efficient embedded systems design
- Solar power harvesting techniques
- Wireless sensor networks
- Full-stack web development
- Time-series data analysis
