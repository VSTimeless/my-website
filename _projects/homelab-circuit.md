# Home Lab Power Supply

This project is a custom-built variable power supply for my electronics home lab, featuring:

- Adjustable voltage output (0-30V)
- Current limiting (0-3A)
- Digital display for voltage and current
- Overheat protection
- Short circuit protection

## Design Goals

The main goals for this project were:

1. Create a reliable power source for various electronics projects
2. Practice PCB design and fabrication
3. Implement proper safety features
4. Build a compact unit that saves bench space

## Components Used

- LM317/LM338 voltage regulators
- LCD display module
- Custom-designed PCB
- Aluminum heatsink
- Toroidal transformer
- Rotary encoders for precise adjustment

## Future Improvements

I plan to add the following features in the next version:

- Bluetooth connectivity for remote monitoring
- Preset voltage/current combinations
- Data logging capabilities
- Multiple isolated outputs
